This directory includes most of the scripts used in comparing the solar 
simulation results with observations. It devides into two parts: in situ 
comparison (compare_insitu.pro) and remote comparison (compare_remote.pro). 
In principle, the in situe and remote comparisons can be done at the same time
with compare_all.pro, but some Solar SoftWare (SSW, based on IDL) versions 
might complain with the environment set up.

The steps to perform in situ comparison:
1. Do 'setenv_insitu.sh' in the terminal, this script will set up the SSW
   environment and start SSW.
2. Enter 'compare_insitu' in IDL. compare_insitu.pro will loop thourgh all 
   the files with the patten '*sat' in the simulation results directory and
   produce the figures in the output directory. The corresponding satellite
   as well as the time range will be determined by the script, so that users
   don't need to enter anything information. The default directories for
   the simulation results and the output are './simdata/' and './output/', 
   respectively. Users could change them by using dir_sim and dir_plot.

The steps to perform remote (light of sight) comparison:
1. Do 'setenv_remote.sh' in the terminal, this script will set up the SSW
   environment and start SSW.
2. Enter 'compare_remote' in IDL. compare_remote.pro will loop thourgh all 
   the files with the patten 'los*dat' in the simulation results directory and
   produce the figures in the output directory. The corresponding satellite
   as well as the event time will be determined by the script. The default 
   directories for the simulation results and the output are './simdata/' 
   and './output/', respectively. Users could change them by using dir_sim 
   and dir_plot. The script will also write a log file log_compare_remote.log.
   It is recommended to read the log file after running the script to see
   if everything is correct.

In both scripts, the file name for the outputs (figures) will use the 
Carrington rotation number followed by the instrument information. The users
can choose to use the event time instead of the Carrington rotation number by
setting UseTimePlotName=1. The default figure format is '.eps', which can
also be changed with TypePlotFile='png'. ONLY eps and png figures are supported
at this moment. The character size can be specified with CharSizeLocal=1.5 (by
default).

Finally, the steps to perform both in situ and remote comparisons are similar:
1. Do 'setenv_all.sh' in the terminal
2. Run 'compare_all' in IDL.
